# CCometixLine Model Configuration
# This file defines model display names and context limits for different LLM models
# File location: ~/.claude/ccline/models.toml

models = []

# Model configurations
# Each [[models]] section defines a model pattern and its properties
# Order matters: first match wins, so put more specific patterns first

# Example of how to add new models:
# [[models]]
# pattern = "glm-4.5"
# display_name = "GLM-4.5"
# context_limit = 128000
